### Postmortem: Chess Game MVP Outage

#### Issue Summary

- **Duration of the Outage**: June 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM UTC
- **Impact**: The Chess Game MVP was entirely non-functional. Users were unable to make moves or access the game interface. Approximately 100% of users were affected.
- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a bug in the move validation logic, which led to an infinite loop when certain invalid moves were processed, causing the system to hang.

#### Timeline

- **10:00 AM**: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high CPU usage on the server.
- **10:05 AM**: Initial investigation began, focusing on server performance and potential external attacks.
- **10:15 AM**: Engineering team noticed the system hang when testing user input, suggesting a deeper issue.
- **10:30 AM**: Assumption made that the issue was due to a recent update in the move validation logic.
- **11:00 AM**: Misleading debugging paths included inspecting network issues and checking for hardware failures, which were ruled out.
- **11:15 AM**: Incident escalated to the lead software engineer and the backend team for a more in-depth code review.
- **11:30 AM**: Detailed review of the move validation logic revealed the presence of an infinite loop.
- **12:00 PM**: The problematic code was identified and fixed by adding proper exit conditions.
- **12:15 PM**: System was tested and confirmed to be functional.
- **12:30 PM**: Service was fully restored and the issue was resolved.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The root cause of the outage was a bug in the move validation logic. Specifically, the code failed to handle certain invalid moves correctly, leading to an infinite loop. This caused the system to become unresponsive and hang, making it impossible for users to interact with the game.
- **Resolution**: The issue was resolved by adding appropriate exit conditions in the move validation logic to prevent infinite loops. The updated code was thoroughly tested to ensure that all possible invalid moves were handled correctly without causing the system to hang.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Improve the robustness of the move validation logic to handle all edge cases.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect infinite loops and other performance issues earlier.
  - Implement automated tests for move validation to catch similar issues during development.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Patch Move Validation Logic**: Review and update the move validation code to ensure all edge cases are covered.
  - **Add Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for CPU usage and system hangs specifically related to move validation processes.
  - **Automated Testing**: Develop and integrate a suite of automated tests for move validation to be run during the continuous integration process.
  - **Code Review**: Establish a more rigorous code review process for critical sections of the codebase, particularly those involving game logic.
  - **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes in move validation logic and include guidelines for handling similar issues in the future.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the stability and reliability of the Chess Game MVP, preventing similar outages from occurring in the future.
